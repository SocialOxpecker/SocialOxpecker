Version History
===============

0.0.2-Alpha
-----------
 * Minor improvement to configuration.
 * Added support for clean up of favorites, retweets, statuses, direct messages

NOTE:  retweets should be covered by status cleanup, this should mainly server as a fail-safe.
[WARNING]
This fails to build with JDK7.  I think it's an know issue with twitter4j.  I'll fix this once they release an update.


0.0.1-Alpha
-----------

 * Added support for twitter cleanup.
 * This app will ask for permission and flush out your entire twitter stream
 from your first post onwards.
